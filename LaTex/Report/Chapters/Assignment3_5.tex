\chapter{Exercise 3.5}
\textbf{Implement a model that demonstrates a system design that transfer data at the TLM level
refined to BCAM level. Use the sc\_fifo to model communication at the TLM level and refine it to
BCAM using adapters as inspiration study the example project SmartPitchDetector (InAdapter.h
and OutAdapter.h). Here a master sends data to a slave using a sc\_fifo and an adapter that
converts to the bus cycle accurate interface on the receiving slave. Use the model from exercise
3.4 for the interface at the Avalon-ST sink interface for the slave as illustrated below}
